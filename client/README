# prompt for creating upload functionality: 
@src you are an expert front end developer. Modify this applicaiton to enable .pdf document upload. Include an upload button in the chat-bottombar, to the right of the send button - ensure token count is to the right of the upload button. Add a  upload route inside the app>api folder. Create a new upload component in the components folder; have this be called in the chat-bottombar. If you think there's a better, cleaner and simpler way to do this, please do so. Here is the api endpoint code where the document is sent: @app.post("/upload")
async def upload(file: UploadFile, user_id: str):  # Changed parameter order and removed task_id
    """Handle document upload"""
    upload_task = DocumentUploadTask(user_id=user_id)
    
    # Add the upload task to active_uploads
    active_upload_tasks[user_id] = upload_task   
    
    result = await upload_task.astart_upload(file)
    return {"task_id": user_id, **result}


1. I'll help you add PDF upload functionality to the application. I'll break this down into several steps:
First, let's create the upload component
Then modify the chat-bottombar
Finally, create the upload API route
Here's the implementation:



This implementation:
Creates a reusable UploadButton component that handles file selection and upload
Modifies the chat-bottombar to include the upload button in a clean layout
Adds a server-side upload route that forwards files to your Python backend
The upload button appears to the right of the input field, followed by the token count and send button. The layout is responsive and maintains the existing styling patterns.
Some key features:
PDF-only file validation
Loading state during upload
Error handling and user feedback via toast notifications
Clean integration with existing UI components
Proper typing and error handling throughout
You'll need to ensure your environment variables include API_BASE_URL pointing to your Python backend. The upload endpoint will forward files to ${API_BASE_URL}/upload with the appropriate user ID.
Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?



Key changes:
Added a custom dialog component for the upload interface
Made the dialog smaller with max-w-[300px]
Simplified the dialog content
Added a clean file input style
Added upload status indicator
Made text and components smaller with text-sm
Added dialog state management
Auto-closes dialog on successful upload
The dialog should now be more compact and cleaner looking. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the size or styling further!
