      "Texture significantly influences the mechanical properties of magnesium alloys, particularly in their deformation behavior and strength. Research indicates that the texture of magnesium alloys, such as AZ31 and AZ80, evolves during processing, affecting their performance. In the AZ31 alloy, higher strains lead to a stronger texture; however, dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains exhibit lower texture intensity compared to un-recrystallized grains. Conversely, the AZ80 alloy shows that DRXed grains closely follow the texture of the deforming grains, indicating a more uniform texture development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strain rate also plays a crucial role, as increasing the strain rate enhances texture intensity, especially in the AZ80 alloy. The differences in aluminum content between alloys like AZ31 and AZ80 contribute to variations in texture development during deformation. Notably, studies have shown that un-recrystallized regions of the AZ91 alloy display a more pronounced basal texture than AZ31 during hot rolling, further emphasizing the impact of alloy composition on texture and, consequently, mechanical properties. Additionally, texture randomization has been observed in extruded AZ31 alloy when compressed parallel to the prior extrusion axis, highlighting the complexity of texture evolution in response to processing conditions. Overall, the relationship between texture and mechanical properties in magnesium alloys is intricate and influenced by factors such as strain, strain rate, and alloy composition.\n",
